# Welcome to the Sounding Plot Viewer!

## About
This is a simple program that takes data from weather balloon launches and displays the data onto a 2D and 3D map so you can see the trajectory of the balloon as it moves through the atmosphere.

## Disclaimer
This is a starter project and is originally designed to be used post-operations to assist in visualizing the motion of a weather balloon. It is not meant as a replacement for any of the tools used during operations. It is meant to be a supplemental tool for analysis and for viewing archived weather balloon data.

## Information
The program takes the latitude, longitude, and geometric altitude data from weather balloon archives and plots the data onto a 3D map. Data file format is comma delimited (.csv).

## Goals
- Plot the latitude and longitude data onto the map for a basic 2D trajectory
- Add geometric altitude data for a 3D trajectory

## Stretch Goals
- Add further data analysis capabilities to the program
